My name is Valerij and I am a pharmacist, who during his PhD started getting more involved with coding and ended up becoming an cheminformatician, who still tries to hone the software development skills. While I started my journey into coding on my own and was learning by myself during my first coding projects, a lot of knowledge was gained through open-source projects and interacting with different software developers from the computational chemistry open-source community, which started with me participating in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). There I was selected to be a contributor for [MDAnalysis Google Summer of Code 2024](https://www.mdanalysis.org/2024/05/27/gsoc-outreachy-students/). Through this I was able to learn from more experienced software developers and from that moment I try to continue contributing to various open-source projects.

Here is the list of some open-source projects I am involved with and a couple of my projects:
